Then I'll help you never feel helpless at their mercy again. Together we will find the gap why it has not worked so far. Imagine if it were easy to heal on your own. If you think this is impossible, then you are wrong. You can become a happier and contented person again.</p>

            <h4 class="colorGreen">Chronic diseases</h4>
            <p>Over 90% of all diseases in our Western civilization are of a chronic nature and there are no successful treatments for them, at least not in the field of conventional medicine. Modern medicine is rooted in the collective belief that we must eliminate the symptoms of disease in order to regain our health. If instead we turned our attention to restoring the mechanisms responsible for creating and maintaining good health, health would naturally return. It is not the disease that needs attention, it is the patient who needs love, care, nourishment and a sense of wholeness again. The most important experience that the imbalanced body/mind needs to heal is the happiness that comes from removing congestion and imbalances present in the body. This is an important self-help process that has a positive effect on the heart, body and soul.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h4>Why are we ill? </h4>
          <p>The most important lesson we can learn from the study of health and healing is that a natrual living and behaving can prevent the development of disease. Disease arises when we deviate from this way of life. If we don't keep the timeless and fundamental laws of nature, we get ill. Disease manifests itself when the body tries to neutralize and eliminate accumulated toxins and fluids. In order to restore health, we must help the body remove these toxins; a nutritious diet and natural health care will prevent re-accumulation of these toxins. Disease is the occurrence of a toxicity crisis. A toxicity crisis is the body's attempt to return to a balanced state (homeostasis). Toxins have harmful effects on organ systems (liver, colon, lungs, kidneys, lymphatic and skin glands, etc.) in the body. Toxins can include chemical food additives, environmental pollutants, metabolic waste, and toxins produced by bacteria that break down undigested food in the gut. Once the body's tolerance level for toxins is reached, it signals pain or other types of discomfort.</p>
          <h4>What makes us ill? </h4>
          <p>The fact that our modern society is plagued with so many chronic diseases shows that entire generations have ailments mainly caused by stress, unhealthy diet and harmful lifestyles. People who lived 100 years ago and enjoyed good hygienic conditions were much less prone to chronic diseases than we are today. For example, heart disease, one of the main causes of death today, rarely killed anyone at the beginning of the 20th century. Our age is characterized by sensory overload, which has a strong energy-draining effect on the body. Here are the main reasons:</p>
         <div class="gradient">
          <ul ><li> Processed foods with thousands of chemical additives (e.g. emulsifiers, coloring agents,
            harmful preservatives, flavorings etc.)</li>
            <li> Fast food</li>
            <li> Animal products (meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, cream)</li>
            <li> Microwaves that alter and destroy food molecules - the small “micro-" waves render food</li>
            useless to the body
            <li> Toxic and aggressive cosmetic products from questionable production with cheap oils</li>
            <li> Chemicals in hygiene products (deodorants, pads, creams, perfumes, hairspray, etc.)</li>
            <li> Drinking water fluoridation (there are huge amounts of chlorine, drug residues, hormones,
            microplastics, pesticides, etc. in drinking water)</li>
            <li> Environmental toxins (kerosene, petrol, exhaust fumes, industrial waste, radiation)</li>
            <li> Drugs with toxic ingredients, vaccine doses</li>
            <li> Nitrites/ hormones/ tranquilizers/ antibiotics in meat products</li>
            <li> Pesticides and antibiotics in fish, heavy metal pollution in fish</li>
            <li> Herbicides/ chemical fertilizers in fruits and vegetables</li>
            <li> Genetically modified food (animals also eat 80% geneticallymodified soy)</li> 
             <li>Cheap furniture covered in chemicals</li>
             <li>Clothing soaked in chemicals</li>
             <li>Smoking, alcohol, drugs</li>
             <li>Overeating and sumptuous meals in the evening</li>
             <li>Excessive protein consumption of animal origin</li>
             <li>Dehydration</li>
             <li>Refined salt and refined sugar</li>
             <li>Heavy metal exposure (seafood, amalgam fillings in the mouth)</li>
             <li>Lack of sleep & sleeping at the wrong times</li>
             <li>Stress</li>
             <li>Lack of exercise and sport</li>
             <li>Radiation exposure (mobile phone antennas, Internet, X-rays, ultrasound, CT, electrosmog,
            etc.)</li>
             <li>Sugar, candy and chocolate</li>
             <li>Artificial light irradiation</li>
             <li>Watching TV too often and for too long</li>
             <li>Short of time and the pressure of having too much to do</li></ul></div>
             <p>All of these factors lead to the accumulation of potentially toxic waste products in the body. Over time, the body is unable to rid itself of all the metabolic and cellular waste products. As a result,  many of these waste products and the resulting toxins spread throughout the body. Thus, the body's resistance to diseases (immunity) drops to a low level. When the body is forced to hold on
              to too many toxins, it is also more susceptible to infections of all kinds. When an infection is treated with suppressive rather than supportive measures, chronic disease can result.</p>

                <h4>Way out of the disease without pharmaceuticals</h4>
                <p>If food has made you sick, food plus a healthy lifestyle will make you healthy again. You will Need to change a few things in your life. You can't get well by clinging to habits that made you sick. If you follow my recommendations without cheating, you will see positive changes in you - guaranteed! The methods work, but you have to have the will to persevere. The biggest obstacle to success is the fear of change. Like any addict, people develop cravings for sugar, bread, readyto-eat cereal, pizza, or cheese soon after beginning their detox and abandon them. For those who  continue, a detoxification process begins that causes half of the "non-dropouts" to run away, because the detoxification process that begins brings to light all kinds of waste products that have been stored in the body's cells for years or even decades. These people will be healed of every disease they have ever had. People feel great, so great and so invulnerable that they want to celebrate their victory a bit... with a return to old habits that make them ill again. In this way, they are constantly oscillating between sickness and health. Over the years, they gradually change their eating habits so that they eat more and more healthy foods. Have courage - this is a completely normal learning process.</p>
                <h4>Why natural remedies instead of conventional medicine?</h4>
                <p>Natural remedies as a whole do not have the fatal side effects of conventional medicine. Nature is impartial and unbiased. Nature doesn't care if you're poor or rich, young or old. If you obey its
                  laws, it will spill the cornucopia of life force upon you. But if you intend to cheat, be warned: every action you take has consequences. This is a cosmic law. You can neither fool nor rip off nature.
                  Because you too are a piece of nature. Nature always has the last word. You can't gorge yourself on pizza, spaghetti, and candy, drink alcohol or soda, and take some high blood pressure pills
                  and expect nothing to happen. Conventional medicine only treats the symptoms and never the causes. It is not the doctor who heals you, but your body. If you ask your doctor about the causes of your symptoms, he will probably just shrug his shoulders.</p>

                  <h4>Wild herb vital food therapy</h4>
                  <p>This therapy involves native wild plants added to smoothies, juices or salads. The wild plants are often more healing than the most expensive drugs from the pharmacy, their healing power is unsurpassed. Local wild herbs are full of nutrients such as biophotons, enzymes, minerals, vitamins and phytochemicals. Sting nettles, mallow leaves and dandelion, for example, provide between five and 50 times more nutrients than organically grown vegetables. Their outstanding abundance of nutrients can hardly be surpassed. Wild plants are nature's highly concentrated medicine. They are unchanged to this day (without genetic manipulation, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.).

                    The wild herb vitality diet uses both local wild herbs and superfoods such as sprouts, probiotic drinks and vitality foods. The immune system and metabolism benefit from these nutrients. Here, vegan raw food is used over a longer period of time.</p>
                    <h4>Fermentation juices </h4>
                    <p>Taste full-bodied and have a lot of healing power 

                      The healthy, dextrorotatory lactic acid from the fermented drinks displaces the toxic, levorotatory lactic acid from the cells and allows the mitochondria to absorb oxygen. The lactic Acid fermentation process increases the bioavailability of vital substances, which the intestine can then absorb more easily.</p>
                      <h4>Plant juices</h4>
                      <p>Plant juices are rich in oxygen, minerals and enzymes, which have exactly the same effect on pathogenic organisms as a hydrochloric acid bath has on humans. These juices (including wheatgrass juice, vegetable juices, fruit juices, green chlorophyll-rich leafy vegetables, etc.) create an environment within you in which viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other altered cells cannot survive. Your stomach acid will be as strong as it should be. Since stomach acid also has the task of killing parasites in our food, most people cannot get rid of their "parasites" due to low stomach acid. In fact, so many parasites cavort in our stomach and intestines because they find such an abundant supply of food there. The combination of weak stomach acid and parasites can be the cause of many diseases. Things to avoid: gluten, sugar, meat and dairy products</p>

                      <p>Andreas Moritz was one of the greatest naturopaths of our time and was active in the most diverse areas of medicine. Above all, he became known for his liver and gallbladder cleansing method. He had helped thousands of people regain their health through this method.</p>
                      <p>Experience has shown that natural liver cleansing is the perfect measure for effective relief and  activation of all organs. It supports us in the long term in the elimination of stubborn and partly stored waste products, toxins and parasitic infestations. It is one of the most important Health applications in the 21st century in order to grow old healthy, vital and happy. </p>

                        <h4>What do "toxins" mean in the body? </h4>
                        <p>Toxins are secretions and waste products, liver mucus, bursa, cysts, diverticula, parasites,
                          bilirubin, synthetic deposits, intestinal pockets, intestinal sludge, heavy metals (mercury, lead,
                          cadmium, arsenic, etc.), lymphatic threads and mucus, glandular toxins, bacteria, etc.</p>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                      <h4>Why cleanse the liver? </h4>
                      <p>The liver filters 1.5 liters of blood per minute and produces about 1 liter of bile per day. The liver is the body's largest organ and also its largest gland, it has over 500 functions in the body and controls every cell in the body. Retained toxins form gallstones over time that eventually clog the liver and bile. When you are exposed to the above toxins on a daily basis, your liver eventually reaches a limit where it is no longer able to filter as much. It begins to retain the most toxic
                        substances, which eventually turn into larger stones. Over time, stones also form in the bile, blocking the flow of bile, which is important for digestion. Without bile, food begins to ferment in the gut (for decades!!) and this leads to infection and disease. The liver now gives orders to secrete the toxins in other areas of the body. Wherever the body's absorption capacity for Toxins and waste products is exceeded, sooner or later symptoms of illness appear. These symptoms
                        are nothing more than an indication that the body is desperately trying to fight this imbalance and heal itself. </p>
                        <h4>A life without gallstones</h4>
                        <p>Invisible to doctors: The majority of gallstones in the liver contain the same components as liquid bile, with cholesterol being the main component. Many stones are made up of fatty acids and other organic matter that has entered the bile ducts. The fact that most of these stones are simply hardened clumps of bile and other organic material makes them virtually invisible to X-rays, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT). </p>

                          <h4>Fasting</h4>
                          <p>Every great healer, every great religion recommends fasting. Few people realize how important
                            fasting is - it's the best thing we can do for ourselves.
                            Fasting is the best Medicine
                            </p>
                            <p>The first step in the healing process is detoxification, so that the organs and immune system can work efficiently again. The body needs to be rebuilt from the ground up to create new, healthy cells if we are to focus on regeneration. This means that the body must first get rid of the Toxins so that the vitality can increase again. Fasting not only cleanses the body, but also the mind and soul. It is amazing that even spiritual wounds can be healed by fasting. It is a letting go of material things in the body and a letting go of negative feelings and deep wounds in the soul. Fasting is liberating and you can see many things clearly again that you previously only perceived as blurry. Fasting means a new beginning on both levels. One is filled with a wonderful peace and all worries dissolve.</p>

                          soul. It is amazing that even spiritual wounds can be healed by fasting. It is a letting go of material things in the body and a letting go of negative feelings and deep wounds in the soul. Fasting is
                          liberating and you can see many things clearly again that you previously only perceived as blurry. Fasting means a new beginning on both levels. One is filled with a wonderful peace and all
                          worries dissolve.</p>
                      <p>When we don't eat, the body focuses on cleaning cells and tissues of any toxic waste that has accumulated there. During a fast, pathogens, tumors, growths and even parasites die off - they
                        starve because they no longer have a source of food. We don't have to worry about ourselves, because our cells have stored sufficient reserves of nutrients for a long time.</p>
                 <p>yes you pick up But what you lose there is nothing that you will lack: fat, toxic waste products and whatever else your body neither needs nor wants. If you've been eating pizza, coffee, pasta,
                  meat, potatoes, bread, cheese, fast food, and fizzy drinks, then you're going to lose quite a bit of weight and size. In this case, the cells in your body are mostly made up of garbage. Your cells first
                  get rid of this garbage - they remove everything down to the basic structure and then rebuild everything properly. </p>
                <p>At the beginning of the fasting cure, there are usually certain detoxification reactions such as headaches, drowsiness, weakness, nausea, stomach cramps, body odor, back pain, etc. The
                  more the body is "poisoned", the more severe the reactions. But that is quite normal and after 1-3 days it is over. It's not the fasting that's to blame for your misery, it's the garbage your body is
                  excreting. Rejoice that all this legacy is finally coming out and will never bother you again.</p>
                <p>During this time it is important that colon cleansing is also carried out so that the toxins are 100% transported out. Our body excretes solid food residues through the long intestine. Exposure to
                  chemicals and poor quality diets low in enzymes cause the gut to weaken. Residues can no longer be completely excreted, which leads to the proliferation of undesirable bacteria. So the
                  intestines get sick, and the body shows symptoms of intoxication. That is why you have to do regular colonic irrigation and enemas.</p>
              <p>A lot of exercise in the form of walks or yoga is also recommended.<br>

                <h4>Juice fasting </h4>
                <p>Solid food is avoided, but plenty of fresh juices are allowed to be drunk. This provides the body with energy and nutrients. Juices are simply part of the human diet. Fresh, natural juices from organically grown foods offer us the nutrients of plants in their most digestible form. This type of enzyme-rich diet not only gives you strength and endurance. It also cleanses and heals, it supplies your body with liquid and relieves kidneys and breathing.</p>
                <p>With each passing day the healing goes deeper. You may not see or feel any change, but Deep down, at a basic cellular level, things are happening. You can't expect the garbage of 30 or 40 years of living an unhealthy lifestyle to go away in a few days or weeks. The more time you give your body, the more fine-tuned it becomes.</p>
                <p>The craving for certain foods disappears after two to three days and you reach a state of complete lightness. At this point, fasting becomes a spiritual experience. You will feel wonderful, completely calm. Your liver is probably full of toxins that have been stored there for decades. Getting rid of all this takes time. But the reward for this effort is a new, longer and healthier life.</p>

                <h4>Healing Clay fasting </h4>
                <p>Healing Clay is nature's best remedy

                  Also called “earth fasting”, it is based on the most natural medicine available to man, the clay.
                  Nothing is drunk other than natural water plus a certain amount of purified healing clay.</p>
                <p>Healing clay absorbs toxins and remineralizes the intestinal flora.

                  Healing clay acts like a sponge that can absorb toxins. The particles can both absorb liquid and attach substances to the surface. The finer the clay is ground, the larger its surface and the higher its binding capacity</p>
                <p>Longer clay fasting restores the impaired or destroyed intestinal flora, better, brings back the
                  myriads of macteria and bacilli necessary for digestion into the intestine: Because they now find a healthy, uncontaminated climate again and can multiply again. At the same time, earth Fasting takes away the poison-forming putrefactive bacteria that had to form in your intestinal tract from eating animal food.</p>

                <h4>Colon cleanse and sanitation</h4>
                <p>Even the healthiest diet will be of no use to you without purging and detoxifying your body first.
                  You have to blow through your digestive tract first. This is the basic requirement that you cannot avoid if you want to see results. Water is the ultimate universal cleaning agent. We should wash ourselves inside and out.</p>
                <p>Long-term intake of antibiotics, hormones, medicines and industrial food often severely affects the intestinal flora and the intestinal mucosa. A damaged intestinal mucosa can become leaky and full of holes (leaky gut syndrome). These small holes allow toxins to enter the blood and lymphatic system and cause inflammation.</p>
              <p>Sure, the idea of pumping water up your butt might make you a little uncomfortable, but what's the fuss, it's just water. You wash your car and your underwear, blow out the gas lines in your car, clean the siphon in the kitchen - isn't it time to think about yourself?</p>
              <p>This therapy is accompanied by various natural aids such as zeolite, physillium, chlorella powder, bitter substances, papaya seeds, etc.</p>

              <h4>Sulfur cure 
              </h4>
              <p>Natural sulfur is an essential mineral that the body uses to produce many of its amino acids and proteins. In the body, sulfur ensures that the cells use oxygen effectively and, if damaged, can be
                repaired. Basically, without sulfur in the body, no healing process can take place. It regulates the supply of nutrients to the cells and the breakdown of waste products. Organic sulfur has a bitter aftertaste when taken pure, which is all the more pronounced when there are many toxins in the body. The less toxic the body is, the less bitter the sulfur tastes. So if you find it very bitter, you can assume that you are suffering from a significant sulfur deficiency. A toxic effect of organic sulfur is not known. Even if you ingest too much of it, your body would just throw it out.</p>
              <h4>Kidney cleanse </h4>
              <p>The kidneys continuously and tirelessly filter our blood from metabolic end products - they are our body's own purification plants. They regulate the fluid and mineral balance, blood pressure, hormone production, acid and base balance, bone metabolism, etc. If the kidneys are diseased (e.g. cystitis, pyelitis, kidney stones, etc.), painful symptoms occur. </p>
            <p>
              A comprehensive change in diet and special cleansing with special herbs can go a long way towards healing the kidneys and keeping them healthy.
            </p>        
            <h4>Lymphatic system cleansing</h4>
            <p>The lymphatic system is an important part of the immune system. Among other things, it is responsible for fighting infections. The lymphatic fluid flows through a network of lymphatic vessels that runs through the entire  body. These vessels are roughly comparable to the veins in which blood flows through the body. Nutrients and other substances enter the body tissues with the blood; the lymphatic vessels, on the other hand, transport fluid from the tissue and transport it to the lymph nodes. If the lymphatic system is overburdened and blocked, degenerated endogenous proteins can no longer be transported away. The result is lymphedema. This edema can become very large and can cause pain.

              There are hardly any diseases that are not caused by lymphatic congestion. Lymphatic congestion is most often caused by congestion in the liver, which in turn can lead to digestive disorders such as constipation, diarrhea, leaky gut syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, Food allergies, parasitic infections, etc. In extreme cases, it can lead to lymphoma or lymph cancer, with Hodgkin's disease being the most common type.</p>
              <ul>The lymphatic system can be cleaned with various combined methods:
               <li> diet change</li>
               <li> lifestyle change</li>
               <li> Exercise in the fresh air</li>
               <li> Swing on the trampoline</li>
               <li> dry brush massage</li>
               <li> contrast showers</li>
               <li> No chemical care products</li>

                <h4>Skin and body care without chemical products </h4>
                <p>Personal hygiene includes washing, bathing, showering, hair, mouth, teeth and nail care.</p>
                <p>The oversupply of hair care and styling products damages the hair and scalp due to their
                  problematic ingredients. For example, silicones, synthetic surfactants or fragrances can irritate the scalp and throw its pH value out of balance. The hair becomes greasy more quickly, so you have to wash it more often.
                  </p>
                <p>Toothpaste contains the neurotoxin fluoride and many other chemical additives. The
                  substances are suspected of irritating the mucous membranes and attacking the
                  intestinal flora. A fluoride-free toothpaste consists of natural substances that ensure
                  healthy oral hygiene.</p>
                <p>Aluminum is found in most deodorants. Among other things, the intake of aluminum can
                  cause neurotoxic development disorders as well as damage to the kidneys, liver and
                  bones. There is also evidence that deodorants containing aluminum increase the risk of
                  breast cancer and Alzheimer's. Here, too, there is an inexpensive alternative to making
                  your deodorant purely plant-based and natural.</p>

    <h4>Ruth Sabrina Orpeli-Meier</h4>
    <p>I was born in Switzerland in 1984, my mother tongue is Swiss German. I have lived in Israel since
      2014.</p>
      <p>I'm a nutritionist. Naturopathic medicine has always interested me and I finally have time to
        pursue this passion. I am convinced that only nature can bring us true healing. In my healing
        therapy I combine many methods such as wild herb therapy, liver cleansing, colon cleansing,
        superfood, nutritional therapies and much more.
        Successful nutritional advice is based on perceiving the person as a whole. It is important to me
        to understand the connections between lifestyle and diet and well-being and to be able to offer
        holistic measures based on this.
        I would like to pass on a lifestyle that enables profound health into old age. My job in this world is
        to provide the best possible support for people with health problems.</p>
    <p>In addition, my work is based on the teachings of geniuses who left vast works and knowledge
      and even freed themselves from chronic diseases and helped thousands of other people in the
      process. Greats like Franz Konz, Markus Rothkranz, Dr. Brian Clement, Anne Wigmore, Dr. Max
      Gerson, Dr. Colin Campbell, Max Bruker, Karl Probst, Andreas Moritz etc. My job is to continue to
      practice this knowledge.

      <h4>Guidelines</h4>
      <p>Many people think that food is just there to quell hunger pangs. For vitamins, there are Vitamin pills and dietary supplements that you can take in addition to ready-made products and fast food
        and everything is fine. But very few people think that nutrition can heal. When one thinks of healing today, one thinks of pharmaceuticals and medicinal products. This is a pity.</p>
      <p>We eat too much meat and too many processed foods. The consequences are obvious. Chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and cancer are on the rise.
        The direct connections between our diet and the development of many chronic diseases have long been scientifically proven.</p>
      <p>All chronic diseases and many others have the same cause: an unhealthy, largely toxic diet and lifestyle an excess of disease-promoting factors and lack of health-promoting factors.
        Conversely, there is a diet that counteracts all of these diseases: a diet with wholesome, plantbased foods.</p>
      <p>Proper nutrition brings health to all areas of your life. All parts are connected to each other</p>
